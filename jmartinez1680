I began my career in the mortgage servicing industry, where I quickly discovered that data is the key to staying ahead of accounts that need the most attention. By learning how 
to manipulate and analyze large spreadsheets, I became the go-to person for identifying which customers required urgent assistance — helping my teams work smarter, not harder.

To expand my skills, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analysis program, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in SQL, data visualization, and dashboard creation. 
Combined with my background in collections, vendor management, and compliance, I’m ready to step into a role where I can leverage data to drive informed decisions, improve performance 
metrics, and deliver real impact.
